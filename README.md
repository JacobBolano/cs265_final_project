# Efficient Register Allocation Algorithms

## CS 265 Final Project

Our project focuses on comparing Register Allocation algorithms, implemented on the Bril infrastructure (see Bril-README.md for details)

For in depth analysis and explanation we attatched our report PDF under 'CS_265_Final_Project_Report.pdf'

We implement a Linear Scan Register Allocation algorithm that leverages SSA in comparison to an implementation of an LRU Runtime Register Allocation algorithm.

Please see 'examples/register_allocation.py' for implementaiton details as well as 'brili.ts'.
To easily run our code on benchmarks, see 'examples/linear_spills.toml' and run that file with brench

Thank you for viewing our project!
